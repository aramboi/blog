Summary: Getting shared folders to work for non-GUI virtual machines.

If you need to use features like "Shared folders" in Virtualbox guests you have to install the Guest Additions. With Ubuntu desktop or Windows this is a breeze, but I couldn't find a unified guide on how to do it in a server environment.

First you need to install these:

```
$ sudo apt-get install dkms
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`
```

Make sure the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso is mounted.

![vbox-image][1]

Reboot system. Then do:

```
$ sudo mkdir /media/cdrom
$ sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
$ cd /media/cdrom
$ sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run
```

If you have 64bit Ubuntu you should run the `VBoxLinuxAdditions-amd64.run` file.

**UPDATE:** VirtualBox 4.0 merged the two files in one, `VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`. Also the above image is not accurate for this version, use 'Install Guest Additions...' (Host+D) to load the virtual drive.

You should see something like this:

```
Verifying archive integrity... All good.
Uncompressing VirtualBox 3.2.12 Guest Additions for Linux........
VirtualBox Guest Additions installer
Removing installed version 3.2.10 of VirtualBox Guest Additions...
Uninstalling old VirtualBox DKMS kernel modules ...done.
Building the VirtualBox Guest Additions kernel modules
Doing non-kernel setup of the Guest Additions ...done.
You should restart your guest to make sure the new modules are actually used
Installing the Window System drivers ...fail!
(Could not find the X.Org or XFree86 Window System.)
```

Don't worry about the windows system drivers error as you don't use them on Ubuntu server edition.

After reboot you will be able to mount your shared folders like so:

```
$ sudo mount -t vboxsf shared_folder_name /path/to/folder
```

To mount the shared folders automatically every time you boot, add  this line (without the `sudo`) to the end of `/etc/init.d/rc.local`.

To uninstall the guest additions use:

```
$ sudo /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions*/uninstall.sh
```
